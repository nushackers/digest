`org.nushackers.digest` is basically a running collection of random write-ups about anything computer science. Its heavily inspired by the idea of weekly newsletters that contain some useful information.

We have a list of contributors that take turns to write something each week based on these simple guidelines:

0. Something that you learnt or found interesting.
0. At least remotely Computer Science related. _(Anything really)_.
0. Don't repeat previous topics/posts _(`grep` the repository)_

The goal being that we learn something new each week and this learning compounds over time. We'll also end up with a nice collection of articles that the random observer might find useful.

We are still figuring out how to scale this.

If you're interested in joining the roster or have  suggestions on how this could be better do check out the [github repository](https://github.com/nushackers/digest).
